# Traveling-Salesman-GA
Genetic Algorithm approach in order to solve the Traveling Salesman problem.

This java program (java files located in src/ga) is used to generate random cities on a 200 by 200 coordinate system and uses a genetic algorithm to figure
out a close to optimal route that visits all of the generated cities. In order to use the program you must have a package
called 'ga' that contains all of these files and configure the program with the class 'TS' being the main class and the method 'main' being the main method. You can also change many of the globally used variables in the 'TS' class, 'Population' class
and 'Algorithm' class in order to try and yield different results based on different inputs.

The java program exports two csv files, "InitialRoute.csv" and "FinalRoute.csv" which contain the initial route and the final route that was generated by the algorithm respectively. 

The python script 'plot_routes.py' will plot the data found in the two csv files so that you can visually see the results of the algorithm.

In order to run the python script you must have the 'matplotlib' and the 'csv' libraries which could be installed using pip.
